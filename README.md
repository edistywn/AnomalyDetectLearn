Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

This is my learning note about anomaly detection using Isolation Forest method. Anomaly is a data or observation value that very different from normal value. We also can undertand it as an outliers. How we deal with these kind of data is very difficult because it maybe the outlier it self is a new kind important inforation that means if we remove it we lost our vulnerable data. There are many application of anomaly detection in our daily lives such as credit card fraud detection, fault of machine in the manufacture context, malicious network activity and etc.

The main goal of anomaly detection is build a model that can detect and explain the anomaly of the data. There are many method that we can use to detect anomaly but in this case i will use isolation forest method. Basically this method works like another ensemble tree algorithm. But in this application to detect anomaly it is using distance of spliting in the tree to detect anoamlies.
